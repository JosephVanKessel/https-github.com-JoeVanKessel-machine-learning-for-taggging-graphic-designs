## Project Description

In this project we train and deploy a machine learning model to automatically predict the tags associated with a given image. 

Please read the [project overview](PROJECT.md) before continuing. It contains detailed information about: the purpose of our project, the creation of our dataset, the tools we used to accomplish the goal and more.

## Getting Started
  Follow the [set-up instructions](SETUP.md). After completing these steps you should have the following:
  1. An AWS account
  2. An S3 Bucket named *multi-label-data* with the following structure:
      
          multi-label-data/
            training/
              train.rec
            validation/
              val.rec
            output/
  3. A notebook instance in sagemaker with one file called [file]()

## Usage

Now that you have everything in place you are ready to train, tune and deploy the model.
