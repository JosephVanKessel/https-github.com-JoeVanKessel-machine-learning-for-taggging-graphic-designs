## Project Description

In this project we were tasked with creating a machine learning model to automatically predict the tags associated with a graphic design. 

In this project we train and deploy a machine learning model using Amazon Sagemaker. 

 The goal of this project is to produce a multi-label image classification model to predict the tags associated with any given image. To learn more about 


## Getting Started
1. Follow the [set-up instructions](SETUP.md)

You should now have the following:
- An AWS account
- An S3 Bucket named multi-label-data
- A folders inside of that bucked named training containing a file called train.rec 
- A folder inside of that bucked named validation containing a file called val.rec
- A notebook instance in sagemaker with one file called [file]()

2. 

## Usage
